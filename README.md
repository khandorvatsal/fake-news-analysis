Fake news is a type of yellow press that uses traditional print media as well as modern internet-based social media to promote disinformation or falsehoods.
As a result of the rapid growth of online social networks, fake news has emerged in large numbers and spread over the internet in recent years for various political and economic motives. 
The introduction of the World Wide Web and the quick adoption of social media platforms prepared the path for unprecedented volumes of data transfer in human history. 
Fake news disseminates incorrect information and promotes a lie about a country's statistics or exaggerates the cost of a country's specific services, producing discontent and instability in those countries.
